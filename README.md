ofxKinectCommonBridge
=================

A wrapper for the simple Kinect for Windows library developed at Microsoft in partnership with myself &amp; James George

Starting the library is easy:

````
kinect.start();
````

This creates a 640x480 color image stream and 320x240 depth image stream. A more complex example looks like so:

````
kinect.initSensor(1); // open the 2nd sensor
//kinect.initIRStream(640, 480); // size, you can do IR or Color
kinect.initColorStream(640, 480); // size
kinect.initDepthStream(320, 240, true); // size and close range?
kinect.initSkeletonStream(true); // seated?
````

To update the Kinect, you guessed it:

````
kinect.update();
````

This handles updating all the streams you have initialized.

To draw, choose one or all of:

````
kinect.draw(0,0); // draw the color image
kinect.drawDepth(kinect.getColorPixelsRef().getWidth(), 0); // draw the depth image
````

To access the pixels of any image:

````
ofPixels colorPix = getColorPixelsRef();
ofPixels depthPix = getDepthPixelsRef();///< grayscale values
ofShortPixels rawDepthPix = getRawDepthPixelsRef();	///< raw 11 bit values
````

To get the screen locations of the skeletons and joints of those skeletons

````
if(kinect.isNewSkeleton()) {
		for( int i = 0; i < kinect.getSkeletons().size(); i++) 
		{
      			// has a head? probably working ok then :)
			if(kinect.getSkeletons().at(i).find(NUI_SKELETON_POSITION_HEAD) != kinect.getSkeletons().at(i).end())
			{
				// just get the first one
				SkeletonBone headBone = kinect.getSkeletons().at(i).find(NUI_SKELETON_POSITION_HEAD)->second;
				ofVec2f headScrenPosition( headBone.getScreenPosition().x, headBone.getScreenPosition().y);
				return;
			}
		}
	}

````

Gestures, Face-Tracking, and the Voice API are all on their way.

As of yet 32bit only and, as this is leveraging the Kinect for Windows library, Windows only.

Adding ofxKinectCommonBridge to a Project:
-------------

1. In vs, right click on your project in the solution explorer, and go to properties
2. Expand the Configuration Properties Tab, and click "C/C++"
3. Add 
````
$(KINECTSDK10_DIR)inc
````
to Additional Include Directories
4. Expand the Linker tab and click on General
5. Add 
```````
$(KINECTSDK10_DIR)lib\x86
and 
..\..\..\addons\ofxKinectCommonBridge\libs\KinectCommonBridge\lib\windows
```````
to Additional Library Directories
6. Open the Input Tab under Linker
7. Add
``````
Kinect10.lib
and
KinectCommonBridge.lib
``````
to Additional Dependencies
8. Finally, copy KinectCommonBridge.dll to the bin folder of your application.
9. Done.
